    "Most of the code in a data pipeline consists of a data cleaning process. Each of the functions used to do data cleaning has a clear goal. Let's say, for example, that one of the features that we have chosen for out model is the change of a value between the previous and current day.\n",
    "For each piece of independent functionality, you would write a unit test, making sure that each part of the data transformation process has the expected effect on the data. For each piece of functionality you should also consider different scenarios (is there an if statement? then all conditionals should be tested). These would then be ran as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline on every commit.\n",
    "In addition to checking that the code does what is intended, unit tests also give us a hand when debugging a problem. By adding a test that reproduces a newly discovered bug, we can ensure that the bug is fixed when we think that is fixed, and we can ensure that the bug does not happen again.\n",
