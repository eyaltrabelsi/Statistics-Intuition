    "They don’t really test what you’ll want them to do once hired — Perhaps the most egregious aspect of using coding interviews with senior engineers is that they only test a small aspect what you’re hiring them to do. Senior engineers typically make 3–5x (or more) than new grads. Expecting them to produce 3–5x more code than a new grad is obviously not reasonable — there just aren’t enough hours in the day. Instead, you’re looking for them to enable teams of junior engineers, mentor those people, identify systemic problems, debug the most complex of issues, and when coding, understand complex systems and the intricate work required to code within them. None of these aspects are tested in a coding interview, and it’s one of the main reasons why senior engineers hate them.\n"
